ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY

- This repository contains v2.0 of manim_theoretical libraries. It is an improved version, with more straightforward commands and a better folder and files organisation, with more optional parameters. 

- These files contain my personal libraries to generate slide presentations about my scientific research. You can find examples of the results here: 

- TO DO:

- Elaborate on the Readme.txt
- Include old animations.
- General a cleaner set of files for branes and strings to bend.
- Add a mode to the bulk to explain (non) normalisable modes and how the brane sweeps it up.
