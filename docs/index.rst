Beanim Documentation
=====================

Beanim (Beamer + Manim) is a simple package that aims to reproduce beamer-like vibes in Manim + Manim-Slides configuration.
Its main philosofy is to provide a simple, homogenised template of basic presentation objects so that you can craft your slides in a straightforward way.

.. note::

   This is a personal package under construction. New features and a more optimised organisation will come. Also, if you are an expert in this kind of things, and want to collaborate, you are more than welcome to enhance this humble library! In case you find some and/or have some suggestions, please
   report at `github issues <https://github.com/PanoPepino/beanim/issues>`_.


This is an example of a presentation crafted with Manim + Manim-Slides+ Beanim.
