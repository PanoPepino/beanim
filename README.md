ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY

- This repository contains v2.0 of manim_theoretical libraries. It is an improved version, with more straightforward commands and a better folder and files organisation, with more optional parameters and the cleanest documentation I am able to achieve.

- These libraries are supposed to be used with [manim-slides](https://manim-slides.eertmans.be/latest/) and [manim](https://www.manim.community). 

- These files contain my personal libraries to generate slide presentations about my scientific research. You can find examples of the results [here](https://panopepino.github.io/web_page/main_page/slides.html) . 

- The documentation webpage (ADD HYPERLINK) includes information about the characteristics and examples of each of the classes and their methods included in these libraries. The main reason of its existence is to easily access all objects of these libraries when crafting slides.

- TO DO:

- Elaborate on the Readme.txt
- Add simple description to the main page of the documentation about the aim and target of the libraries.
- Think way to let people choose between two or more templates
- Include old animations:
    - Diagrams
    - Pulling strings and bending branes.
- Code new animations:
    - (Non)-Normalisable modes and the bubble expanding.
    - Smooth transition between global and Poincar√© coordinates for the bubble.
